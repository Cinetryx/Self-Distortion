Self-Distortion
===============

Processing with the use of computer's webcam

The inspiration behind this project was the motion sensors from the Kinect. I decided to use something that was at my 
disposal like my webcam and my laptop to mimic the Kinect. Since I personally do not like taking pictures of myself, I 
wanted to create something that other individuals can relate and use for themselves. This program blurs the image enough to
not see the figure clearly but still visible enough to recognize the user.This is an interactive piece where the user can 
distort what the webcam is viewing. 

The purpose of this piece is to provide the user with the option of escape, allowing themselves to not reveal entirely 
their image and allows them to take something so simple and turn it into a fun collaborating time. Not to mention that 
the red box serves as a distraction for the user in the opposite end who is viewing this transformation and ease off the 
realization of distortion. 
 
How to use:
- In order to begin this transformation, the user needs to hold down any key on the keyboard. Whenever the user lets go 
  of the key, an image will be taken and placed on the user's desktop/documents in a folder
- There is a red square distinguishing the brightest area in the webcam's view
- The more the mouse drags to the right, the more distorted the image will be
- Move mouse to the left, the clearer the image becomes
